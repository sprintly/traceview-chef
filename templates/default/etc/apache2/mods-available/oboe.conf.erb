    # OboeTracingMode: When traces should be initiated for incoming
    # requests. Valid options are "always," "through" (when the
    # request is initiated with a tracing header from upstream) and
    # "never". You must set this directive to "always" in order to
    # initiate tracing.
    OboeTracingMode always

    # OboeSamplingRate: This value reflects the number of requests out
    # of every million that will be traced, and must be an integer
    # between 0 and 1000000. Default is 300000 (30%).
    OboeSamplingRate 1000000

    # By default, don't trace requests for static files.  Feel free to
    # change the file extensions listed here.
